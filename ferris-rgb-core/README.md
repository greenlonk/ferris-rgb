# Ferris-RGB-Core

This is the core library for matrix initialization and content rendering.

It is meant to be domain-driven and typestate-driven.

## What this library is - and what not
The core library's goal is to define how the rgb matrix is being initialized, what types of content exist and how both interact with each other.

It is not:
- a scheduler
- a content manager
- a service runner
